Hi, I'm Larri Fernandez—an IT professional with over 7 years of industry experience and a deep passion for all things tech. My expertise lies in system administration, networking, and security, where I've spent years building, maintaining, and securing infrastructure that just works.

I'm particularly interested in creating resilient, efficient systems, and I’m always exploring ways to make IT operations smoother and smarter. Lately, that’s meant diving into automation with tools like Ansible and Terraform, using code to solve problems before they even happen.

Whether I’m troubleshooting a network issue, tightening security, or automating tedious tasks, I love turning complexity into simplicity. This portfolio is a window into the work I enjoy doing and the skills I bring to every challenge.
